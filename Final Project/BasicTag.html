    <h2>Heading Tag</h2>

    <p>Heading tags are essential elements in web development that help define the hierarchy and structure of the content on a webpage. There are six levels of headings, ranging from level 1 to level 6, where level 1 represents the most important heading (usually the main title of the page) and level 6 is the least important (used for minor sub-sections).</p>

    <p>Types of Heading Tags:</p>
    <h3>Heading 1 (H1):</h3>
    <p>This is the main heading of a webpage, often used for the title or the most significant piece of content.</p>
    <p>There should generally only be one H1 per page to represent the core topic.</p>
    <h3>Heading 2 (H2):</h3>
    <p>Used for subheadings or sections under the H1.</p>
    <p>You can have multiple H2 headings on a page to break the content into main sections.</p>
    <h3>Heading 3 (H3):</h3>
    <p>A subheading that provides further breakdown within sections defined by H2 headings.</p>
    <p>H3 helps in organizing content that is a subset of an H2 section.</p>
    <h3>Heading 4 (H4):</h3>
    <p>Less commonly used but can be applied when you need even more detailed subdivisions under an H3.</p>
    <h3>Heading 5 (H5) and Heading 6 (H6):</h3>
    <p>These are the lowest levels of headings, often used for very specific or granular sections within the content.</p>

    <h3>EXAMPLE : </h3>

    <img src="../image1.jpg" alt="" >
    <br>
    <h3>Output: </h3>
    <img src="../image1.jpg" alt="" >
